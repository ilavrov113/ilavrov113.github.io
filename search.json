I specialize in Empirical Corporate Finance, Financial Economics and Macroeconomics. \n\nI am on the job market in 2024-2025 year. In my job market paper, I study the borrowing costs of previously insolvent firms. \nContact me at ivanlavrov@ucla.edu\nMy CV\nJob Market Paper\n\nScarring Effects of Financial Distress: Evidence from Chapter 11 Reorganizations\nLink to the paper\nAbstract Â  Firms defaulting on their debt often do not go out of business entirely, plenty of them manage to reorganize through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Are their borrowing costs commensurate with their actual post-bankruptcy creditworthiness? I answer this question using a panel of credit spreads of large public US firms that emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1998-2022. I document that an improvement of credit rating by one step is associated with a smaller reduction in borrowing costs for emergent firms than for comparable never-bankrupt firms. This gap is statistically significant for 12 months following the emergence and only for close to investment grade ratings (BB+ or better), while for lower-rated high-yield bonds the spreads are not statistically different or are even lower. My findings suggest that the firms with better post-bankruptcy prospects have weaker incentives to improve their credit ratings due to a smaller reduction of the borrowing costs that they could achieve, and point to a previously undocumented scarring effect of bankruptcy for firms, potentially arising from less efficient bond market after a bankruptcy resolution."
