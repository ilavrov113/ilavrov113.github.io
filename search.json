Are their borrowing costs commensurate with their post-bankruptcy creditworthiness? I answer this question using a panel of credit spreads of large public US firms that emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1998-2022 and show the evidence that a bankruptcy episode has a scarring effect on the firms. I document that an improvement of the credit rating by one grade is associated with a smaller reduction in borrowing costs for emergent firms than for comparable never-bankrupt firms. The effect lasts for up to 12 months after the emergence and is significant only for relatively high ratings, BB- and better. My findings suggest that the firms with better post-bankruptcy prospects have weaker incentives to improve their credit ratings due to a smaller reduction of the borrowing costs they could achieve, and point to a previously undocumented cost of bankruptcy, potentially arising from less efficient bond market after a bankruptcy resolution."
